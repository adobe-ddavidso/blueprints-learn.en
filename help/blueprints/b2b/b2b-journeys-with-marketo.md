## Architecture

## Guardrails

* Capped at 50 account segments per sandbox.
* Batch segmentation evaluation.
  * Automatically evaluated every 24 hours following the completion of the batch audience run and profile export jobs.
  * No edge, streaming, or ad-hoc evaluation support.
* Account attributes are available for export.
* Events of people.
  * Up to 30 days of event lookback, no ordering of event predicates.
  * AND / OR are supported (so you can say "A and B have to happen,"  but you can't say "A must happen 3 days before B").
* Max of 5 million accounts across all account journeys
* Max of 40 million people across all account journeys
* Max of 1,000 people per account in a buying group and journey
* [Profile & Segmentation Guardrails](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/profile/guardrails)

## Implementation steps

* Install B2B schemas and namespaces
  * Using [postman collection](https://github.com/adobe/experience-platform-postman-samples/tree/master/Postman%20Collections/CDP%20Namespaces%20and%20Schemas%20Utility)
  * Using [templates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/sources/ui-tutorials/templates) in the Platform UI
* Configure the [Marketo Engage source connector](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/sources/connectors/adobe-applications/marketo/marketo)
  * Recommendation is to not enable profile without taking into account the [Implementation considerations](#implementation-considerations)
  * Recommendation to ingest Persons, Companies and Activities at a minimum

## Implementation considerations

When implementing Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, it's crucial to understand the identity stitching capabilities provided by the Real-time Customer Data Platform. This platform performs identity stitching at both the person and account levels, ensuring a unified view of customer data.

### Key Points

* **Identity Stitching**: The platform stitches identities using default identifiers such as Marketo ID, CRM ID, and email. This helps in creating a comprehensive profile by merging data from different sources.
* **Potential Risks**: Using email as an identifier for stitching can lead to unintentional identity collapse. This means that different individuals sharing the same email address might be incorrectly merged into a single profile, which can negatively impact CRM data integrity.
* **Merging Strategy**: The platform employs a time-based merging strategy, where the last value ingested for a particular profile attribute is used. This ensures that the most recent data is reflected in the profile.
* **Considerations for Email**: It’s important to carefully evaluate whether email should be used as an identifier for stitching profile fragments. While it can be useful, the risk of identity collapse must be weighed against the benefits.

By keeping these points in mind, you can make informed decisions about how to configure identity stitching in Adobe Journey Optimizer B2B Edition, ensuring accurate and reliable customer profiles.

### Evaluating Identity Stitching Outcomes

Query Service can be used to see the impact of identity stitching in a non-profile enabled data set. The following query can be used to do the evaluation

#### Number of records ingested

This query returns the total number of records ingested into the person profile data set

```sql
select
    count(distinct b2b.personKey.sourceKey)
from
    marketo_person_ajo_b2b
```

#### Duplicate emails

This query returns the number of person records that will be merged as part of the platform's identity stitching

```sql

select
    SUM(personCount)
from
    (
        select
            emailAddress,
            count(*) as personCount
        from
            (
                select
                    MAX(workemail.address) as emailAddress
                from
                    marketo_person_ajo_b2b
                where
                    workemail.address IS NOT NULL
                group by
                    b2b.personKey.sourceKey
            )
        group by
            emailAddress
        having
            count(*) > 1
    )
```

#### Email addresses with duplicate records

This query returns the emails with the most duplicate records in the data set.  This list can be used to check some of these records to better understand how linking the identities may impact Marketo and CRM.  See the [Identity Service overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/identity/home) for more details on how identity linking works.

```sql
select
    *
from
    (
        select
            emailAddress,
            MAX(personId) as personId,
            count(*) as personCount
        from
            (
                select
                    b2b.personKey.sourceKey,
                    MAX(workemail.address) as emailAddress,
                    MAX(b2b.personKey.sourceId) as personId
                from
                    marketo_person_ajo_b2b
                where
                    workemail.address IS NOT NULL
                group by
                    b2b.personKey.sourceKey
            )
        group by
            emailAddress
        having
            count(*) > 1
    )
order by
    personCount desc
```
